## Inspiration 
I have created a strawberry ice-cream cone.

## Journey
To create this I used a combination of circles, ovals and triangles. I learnt about ::before and ::after to create more complex shapes without extra markup, and used the clip-path in combination with a background image to make a cone with texture. In the future I hope to use complex polygon shapes, work with gradients and try to add shading.
